# DeveloperConsole
 
Developer Console that I'm currenly using in my own projects. 

This console is inspired by Dapper Dino's "How to Make a Developer Console in Unity" (YouTube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usShGWFLvUk&t )

For every new command there needs to be a new script with the wanted action to be called and new item created via Asset Menu. New asset items also need to be added on DeveloperConsole prefab, under "Commands".


I'll keep updating this project as I improve the Developer Console as a whole.
